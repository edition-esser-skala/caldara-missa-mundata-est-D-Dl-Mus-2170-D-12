  – &      & ob  & In several movements of \B1,
                   (Gloria, Laudamus, Gratias, Quoniam)

                   remaining movements: no indications
                   the directives “Tutti” and “Vv.” in the violin parts
                   indicate the beginning and end of segments where the oboes
                   should play unison with the violins. Based on these
                   directives, the oboe parts of this edition have been
                   assembled. Nevertheless, the directives are retained
                   in the violin parts. If a chord appears in the violin part,
                   only the highest note is retained for the oboe part. \\
